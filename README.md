The code will be released soon.

# The visual localization system with the w-MSAC for multiple camera pose estimation
(4 Camera + IMU + Visual Localization Database)  

The key challenge lies in the accurate and efficient pose estimation of the multiple cameras under noisy feature correspondences.   

Data for visual localization database creation (08/04)  
Data for visual localization (10/26)  

The visual localization system with the w-MSAC achieves centimeter-level positioning accuracy.
